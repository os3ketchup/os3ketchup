### About Me

I'm a seasoned **Flutter developer** with a strong focus on crafting robust, scalable, and intuitive mobile applications. My journey is guided by a passion for creating exceptional user experiences and architecting clean, maintainable code.

Prior to my career in tech, I worked as an **epidemiologist**. This unique background has sharpened my analytical skills, instilled a meticulous attention to detail, and trained me to think critically about data, patterns, and problem-solvingâ€”a disciplined approach I now apply to every line of code I write.

I specialize in building complex mobile solutions, particularly those involving real-time data, advanced state management, and seamless third-party integrations.
